# Pseudolocalization

> Pseudolocalization (or pseudo-localization) is a software testing method used for testing internationalization aspects of software. Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language, as in the process of localization, the textual elements of an application are replaced with an altered version of the original language.

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'pseudolocalization'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle
